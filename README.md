ðŸš€ Flipkart Mobile Sales Analysis: Key Insights & Learnings

In our recent analysis of mobile sales data from Flipkart, we delved into various product attributes to understand trends and customer preferences. The dataset included key columns such as Product Name, Actual Price, Discount Price, Stars, Rating, Reviews, RAM (GB), Storage (GB), Display Size (inch), and Camera.

Here are some interesting insights from our analysis:

Total Products Listed: We began by evaluating the entire inventory and determined the total number of unique mobile products available on Flipkart. Understanding the variety of offerings helps identify market diversity and product availability.

Total Value of Devices: Next, we calculated the overall cost of all the mobile devices based on their actual prices. This gave us a comprehensive view of the total market value represented by the available stock.

Low-Review Products: To focus on customer feedback, we identified products that received fewer than 100 reviews. This allowed us to highlight potential underperformers or niche products that might require more attention in terms of promotion or improvement.

128 GB Storage Models: Storage capacity is a critical factor for buyers. We filtered out and highlighted mobile phones that offer 128 GB of storage, one of the most popular configurations among customers looking for high storage options.

Display Size and Reviews Correlation: Finally, we examined the various display sizes of the phones and their corresponding total reviews. This helped us understand customer preferences related to screen size and how it impacts purchasing decisions.
